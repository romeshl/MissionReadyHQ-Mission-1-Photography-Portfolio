# MissionReadyHQ-Mission-1-Photography-Portfolio

This is the first project I did at Mission Ready HQ - Full-stack developer accelerator course - Level 4. 

Objective of the first project was to build a webpage using HTML and CSS.

This is my first ever attempt of making a web page using HTML and CSS.

I decided to attempt to make a portfolio website for one of my hobbies which is photography. 

It's deployed in github pages and the link is given below.
